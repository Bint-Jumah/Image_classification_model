This project involves the classification of an objects using supervised learning. The model is trained to identify and differentiate between two different images cat and dog. the model deployed for this was tensor flow. below is the highlight of the steps followed in achieving this
1. create the dataset flow by defining its structure ( dataset-> train-> class 1-> class 2 -> validation -> class 1-> class 2), these involves creating a different folders to the images and combining these different folders into one folder named train
2. the libraries for the model  were imported and the dataset saved on the drive was also mounted
3. data augmentation
4. transfer learning model
5. model accuracy and evaluation
6.
